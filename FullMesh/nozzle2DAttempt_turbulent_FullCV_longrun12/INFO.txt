INFO

First attempt at turbulent with a fine mesh (element size of 0.008 m), again need to look at epsilon and
k files to make sure they have the correct values, first run is just a test with numbers from 
another tutorial  

New for 4:
Added new boundary split for pre and post throat, also increased element size to 0.02 m.

new for 6: Realized i never changed thermoproperties, attempting again with updated file

new for 7:
new try with outlet pressure set to 100 pa


8 and 9: Looking at initial times steps with alternating BC to see if they are being implemented
correctly and to see what is happening at initial steps

10; 
Added boundary cells to go with boundary walls, set those as same boundary conditions and run sim
(not working)

new for 11:
Acting as 7.1, looking to add H2 to the last working sim with the split wall vapor conditions

new for 12: Re running 11 with a much cleaner mesh to look for differences
