INFO

First attempt at turbulent with a coarse mesh (element size of 0.03 m), again need to look at epsilon and
k files to make sure they have the correct values, first run is just a test with numbers from 
another tutorial 

For this run added more to the Converging section of the mesh to see if results change, 
first attempt will be for 0.8 seconds and sparse print frequency to look for convergence
