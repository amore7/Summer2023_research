7: Finally fixed the BC Vacuum

Argon Mach Calc:
(mag(U))/(sqrt((1.67*8.314*T)/(0.03994)))

Outlet(s): 1e-07 Pa 
inlet: 1.034e6 Pa = 150 psi, 400 K
Laminar, no turblance model used
Re of about 15,000 at the throat
Volume is initilized to have the same pressure as the inlet and no velocity, all flow is driven by vacuum

Results from Short case:
Exit velocity: about 625 m/s at the highest
Exit Mach: about 7 at the highest

Geometry: 
Rt = 0.25 mm
Re = 2.25 mm
Cone angle = 10 degrees
L throat to exit = 10 mm
